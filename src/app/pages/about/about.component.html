                    Our Coffee Shop a unique coffee house environment 
                    unlike any other in Macon. We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning 
                    cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where
                     you can sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. If you need to work, we 
                     have a seating area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a 
                     soft-seating area in front of a stone fire place that is perfect 
                     for your weary mind and body. We offer a delicious variety of coffee
                      roasted in house made by our professionally trained baristas. 
                      We have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages. 
                     We look forward to serving you at  Our Coffee Shop
